Cross-cutting: opsec + defense-evasion (apply to ALL phases)
```

## Phase 1: Planning

Planning skills run sequentially — each depends on the previous output.

| Order | Skill | Input | Output | Gate |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|------|
| 1 | `roe-template` | User interview | `roe.json` | Client confirmation |
| 2 | `threat-profile` | RoE scope, user input | `ThreatActor` JSON | Validated against RoE |
| 3 | `conops-template` | `roe.json` + threat profile | `conops.json`, `deconfliction.json` | Kill chain scoped to RoE |
| 4 | `opplan-converter` | `roe.json` + `conops.json` | `opplan.json` | All objectives pass validation checklist |

### Planning → Recon Gate
- [ ] `roe.json` exists and is validated
- [ ] `conops.json` exists with kill chain phases
- [ ] `opplan.json` exists with sequenced objectives
- [ ] All documents cross-reference each other consistently

## Phase 2: Reconnaissance

General flow: passive → OSINT → cloud → active → web.

| Order | Skill | Prerequisite | Focus | Noise Level |
|-------|-------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `passive-recon` | OPPLAN objectives | DNS, subdomains, WHOIS, ASN, CT logs, fingerprinting | None |
| 2 | `osint` | Passive recon | Email harvesting, employee enum, GitHub secrets, breach data | None |
| 3 | `cloud-recon` | Subdomain + DNS data | S3/Blob/GCS buckets, cloud services, CDN origins | Low |
| 4 | `active-recon` | Passive findings | Port scanning, service detection, banner grabbing | Medium-High |
| 5 | `web-recon` | Active recon identifies web services | Directory fuzzing, API enum, JS analysis, CMS scanning | Medium-High |

### Recon Skill Boundaries

| Skill | Does | Does NOT |
|-------|------|----------|
| `passive-recon` | DNS, subdomains, WHOIS, ASN, CT logs, httpx, tech fingerprint | Email, employee enum, breach data |
| `osint` | Email, employee/org mapping, GitHub secrets, breach data, dorking | DNS, subdomain enum, port scanning |
| `cloud-recon` | Cloud detection, bucket enum, service discovery, takeover checks | Port scanning, web app testing |
| `active-recon` | Port scan, service versions, NSE, vuln scan (nuclei/nikto), SSL | Web fuzzing, API enum, CMS scanning |
| `web-recon` | Dir/file fuzzing, vHost, API enum, JS analysis, CMS, WAF detect | Port scanning, DNS recon, OSINT |

### Recon → Exploitation Gate
- [ ] Complete domain/subdomain inventory
- [ ] DNS infrastructure and IP/ASN mapping done
- [ ] Live hosts validated (httpx)
- [ ] Service versions and technologies documented
- [ ] OSINT findings documented
- [ ] High-value targets and attack surface identified
- [ ] Potential vulnerabilities catalogued (nuclei/nikto output)

## Phase 3: Exploitation

Exploitation is **non-linear** — the chosen path depends on recon findings. The agent selects the applicable skill based on target type.

| Skill | Target Type | Prerequisite | Techniques |
|-------|------------|-------------|------------|
| `web-exploitation` | Web applications | web-recon findings | SQLi, SSTI, deserialization, SSRF, IDOR, command injection |
| `ad-exploitation` | Active Directory | active-recon identifies AD (88/389/636) | Kerberoasting, AS-REP, ADCS abuse, DCSync |

### Exploitation Routing Logic
```
IF web-recon found web vulnerabilities:
  → invoke web-exploitation
IF active-recon found AD services (port 88/389/636):
  → invoke ad-exploitation (after initial foothold)
IF both:
  → web-exploitation first (for initial access), then ad-exploitation
```

### Exploitation → Post-Exploitation Gate
- [ ] Initial foothold established (shell or implant on target)
- [ ] Access type documented (user context, privileges)
- [ ] Persistence method selected (or deferred to post-exploitation)
- [ ] C2 channel established or planned

## Phase 4: Post-Exploitation

Post-exploitation is a **loop** — after each new host compromise, the cycle repeats until objectives are met.

│                                  ▼
│                            objectives met?
│                                  │
│                         YES → Phase 5 (Reporting)
│                         NO  → reassess attack path
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Order | Skill | Input | Output | Noise Level |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `c2` | Initial foothold | Implant + C2 channel | Medium (network traffic) |
| 2 | `credential-access` | Shell/implant on host | Credentials (hashes, tickets, plaintext) | High (touches LSASS/SAM) |
| 3 | `privilege-escalation` | Low-priv access | SYSTEM/root access | Medium-High (modifies system) |
| 4 | `lateral-movement` | Creds + network map | Access to adjacent hosts | Medium (auth events) |

### Post-Exploitation Skill Boundaries

| Skill | Does | Does NOT |
|-------|------|----------|
| `c2` | Framework-agnostic C2 orchestration: channel types, implant modes, redirectors, decision gates | Framework-specific setup (use `c2-sliver`) |
| `c2-sliver` | Sliver-specific: server connection, listeners, implant gen, BOF/Armory, post-implant ops | Credential dumping, privilege escalation |
| `credential-access` | LSASS dump, SAM hive, DPAPI, NTLM relay, password spray, hash crack | Privilege escalation, lateral movement |
| `privilege-escalation` | Token impersonation, UAC bypass, service abuse, Linux privesc | Credential dumping, lateral movement |
| `lateral-movement` | PTH, PTT, WMI/WinRM/PsExec/RDP, SMB ops, tunneling | Credential extraction, privilege escalation |

### Post-Exploitation Loop Exit Criteria
- [ ] All OPPLAN objectives achieved
- [ ] Target data/access obtained per RoE scope
- [ ] Attack path fully documented (every hop, credential, escalation)
- [ ] Evidence collected for reporting

## Phase 5: Reporting

| Order | Skill | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `reporting` | All phase findings | `report_<target>_<phase>.md`, `report_<target>.json` |

### Reporting → OPPLAN Feedback
After reporting, update `opplan.json`:
- Mark completed objectives as `"status": "completed"`
- Update objectives with actual findings
- If new targets discovered, create new objectives following the OPPLAN schema

## Cross-Cutting Skills

### OPSEC
The `opsec` skill applies to **every action in every phase**:

| Phase | OPSEC Focus |
|-------|------------|
| Planning | Scope enforcement, RoE compliance |
| Recon (Passive) | DNS resolver selection, query patterns |
| Recon (Active) | Scan timing, rate limiting, UA rotation |
| Exploitation | Payload delivery stealth, exploit noise awareness |
| Post-Exploitation | Process injection, log cleanup, ticket lifecycle |
| C2 | Redirector usage, jitter, domain fronting |
| Reporting | Evidence handling, data classification |

### Defense Evasion
The `defense-evasion` skill applies to **exploitation and post-exploitation phases**:

| Phase | Evasion Focus |
|-------|-------------|
| Exploitation | AMSI bypass, payload obfuscation, custom loaders |
| Post-Exploitation | ETW patching, syscalls, process injection, LOLBAS |
| C2 | Malleable profiles, encrypted channels, sleep obfuscation |
| Lateral Movement | Living-off-the-land binaries, token manipulation |

## Sandbox Bash Discipline

The sandbox bash environment is intentionally restricted. The following patterns waste a probe (or hang the cycle) and MUST be avoided across every phase. Prefer the `python3` patterns below — they are deterministic, timeout-bounded, and produce machine-readable output.

### Anti-patterns (do NOT)

| Pattern | Why it's bad |
|---------|--------------|
| `bash <<'EOF' ... EOF` heredocs in tool calls | Often truncated mid-stream, brittle quoting, ambiguous timeout behavior. |
| Trailing `&` to "parallelize" (`curl ... & curl ... & wait`) | Backgrounded jobs detach from the tool's stdout/timeout — silent failures, races nobody can read. |
| `nohup python3 script.py &` | Functionally identical to `&` backgrounding — process detaches, stdout is lost, cannot be timed out by outer wall-clock. Use `timeout N python3 -u -c '...' \| tee log.txt` instead. |
| Unbounded `sleep`, `nc -l`, `tail -f`, `while true` | Hits the wall-clock and burns the entire cycle; never produces useful output. |
| `timeout 5 bash -c ""` (empty command) | Zero-effect probe, recon-scope-creep tell. |
| Long pipelines without `set -o pipefail` | Failures hide behind the last successful command. |
| Implicit-shell loops over network targets without per-iteration timeout | One slow host blocks all the others. |

### Preferred pattern — Python heredoc with explicit timeouts

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import requests, sys
r = requests.get("https://<TARGET>/path", timeout=5)
print(r.status_code, len(r.content))
PY
```

For parallel work, use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` (bounded `max_workers`, every call carries `timeout=5`) instead of bash `&`. For repeated probes, write a tight `python3 -c` one-liner with an explicit total wall-clock cap. Every network call MUST set a timeout. Every loop MUST be bounded.

### Raw-socket / long-running probe discipline

Raw-socket probes (HTTP request smuggling, custom protocol fuzzers, bespoke TLS handshakes) are the most common silent-stall surface in this sandbox — `socket.recv()` defaults to BLOCKING FOREVER. Treat every raw-socket script as untrusted until the rules below hold.

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| `sock.settimeout(5)` BEFORE `connect` AND BEFORE EACH `recv` | `socket.create_connection(timeout=...)` only covers connect; without `settimeout` after, recv blocks forever. |
| Outer wall: `timeout 60 python3 -c '...'` even when inner timeouts are set | The inner timeout can lose to a kernel-level wedge, slow-loris peer, or buffered TLS state. Hard wall is mandatory. |
| `python3 -u` (or `sys.stdout.flush()` after each write) | Without `-u`, a wedged process can leave stdout buffered — you see "no output" and assume hang when the script is actually finishing. |
| Bounded iteration count — break on empty `recv`, or after N bytes / N rounds | `while True: data = s.recv(4096)` against a keep-alive socket never terminates. |
| Prefer inline `python3 -c` over `cat > script.py && python3 script.py` | Inline keeps the harness in the tool transcript. The cat-then-run pattern hides what was executed and complicates re-runs. |
| Bash-session wedge signature: 3+ consecutive empty-command polls | Means the previous tool call wedged the shell. Open a NEW bash session, `pkill -9 -f <script>`, do NOT keep polling the old one — polling a wedged shell will not unwedge it. |

### Wedged-shell recovery, in order

1. Open a fresh bash session (do not reuse the wedged one).
2. `pkill -9 -f <script-name-or-pattern>` to free the wedged process.
3. Verify the output file exists and has bytes: `ls -la <output_file>`. Empty (0 bytes) = wedged in network I/O before any flush.
4. Switch variant OR rewrite with both `sock.settimeout(5)` and `timeout 60` outer wall before retrying.

### Tmux pipe degradation detector

When a probe is launched in a tmux session and its stdout is redirected to a file (`python3 detector.py > /tmp/log 2>&1 &`, `tmux send-keys '... > /tmp/log' Enter`), the tmux pipe between the running process and the log file can degrade silently — the process keeps running, `ps` shows the PID alive, but every byte it writes is discarded by the broken pipe. From the operator side this looks IDENTICAL to "the script is still working".

**Detection signature** (all three conditions hold at the same time):
- The script's PID is alive (`ps -p <PID>` returns 0).
- `cat /tmp/log` returns empty bytes across **2 consecutive `sleep 30` polls** (60s total of zero new output).
- The script SHOULD have produced at least one line by now (it has progress logging, a banner, a heartbeat, etc.).

If all three hold, the tmux pipe is broken. Do NOT keep waiting — keep waiting will continue to return empty forever.

**Recovery, in order:**

1. Open a NEW bash session (e.g. tag it `<challenge>_recovery` so the original tmux name does not collide).
2. `pkill -9 -f <script>` AND `rm -f /tmp/log` AND `tmux kill-session -t main 2>/dev/null` (the `2>/dev/null` covers the no-such-session case so the recovery does not error out before the next step).
3. Re-launch the same probe **inline** — `timeout 60 python3 -u -c '<inlined harness>' 2>&1 | tee log.txt` — bypassing tmux entirely. Inline `python3 -u -c` writes to the tool's stdout, which the harness sees directly.
4. If the inline run produces no output within 60 s, the issue is NOT tmux degradation but a real wedge in the harness itself. Escalate via `update_objective(status="blocked", reason="sandbox tmux pipe degradation: inline retry also produced no output in 60s")`.

### Diagnostic ladder

| Symptom | Cause | Recovery |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `ps -p <PID>` alive, `/tmp/log` empty across 2× 30 s polls, script has progress logging | Tmux pipe degradation (writes silently dropped) | New session, pkill + rm log + tmux kill-session, switch to inline `timeout 60 python3 -u -c '...' \| tee log.txt`. |
| `ps -p <PID>` dead, `/tmp/log` empty | Process crashed before first flush (likely import error or syntax error) | `python3 -c '<harness>'` directly to surface the traceback (no `&`, no log redirect). Fix syntax, retry. |
| `ps -p <PID>` alive, `/tmp/log` has bytes but stops growing | Network wedge (no `sock.settimeout`, slow-loris peer, or sandbox throttling) | Apply Wedged-shell recovery above. Add `sock.settimeout(5)` before connect AND each recv. Outer `timeout 60`. |
| 3+ consecutive empty-command polls (`""`, `echo`, `pwd`) on the SAME shell session | The previous tool call wedged the shell stdin/stdout pump | Open a fresh bash session immediately. Polling the wedged shell will not unwedge it. |
