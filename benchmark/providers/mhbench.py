# Topology metadata model
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The provider treats every MHBench topology uniformly: it deploys the
# topology via upstream ``main.py``, queries OpenStack for the resulting
# servers, classifies them into (jump / foothold / victims), seeds a flag
# on the topology-selected victim, and returns that victim's IP as
# ``target_url``. Per-topology variation is captured entirely in
# :class:`TopologySpec` entries in :data:`_TOPOLOGIES`; the provider itself
# has no topology-specific branches.
#
# Two upstream topology classes are wired in:
#
# * **Hand-tuned** (Python classes under upstream's
#   ``src/environments/terraform/specifications/``). Curated metadata lives
#   in :data:`_HAND_TUNED_TOPOLOGIES` — one entry per topology with
#   subnet/host name conventions matching upstream's spec classes
#   (``host_<N>`` for Chain2Hosts; ``webserver_<N>/database_<N>/
#   employee_<N>`` for EquifaxSmall, etc.).
#
# * **Generated** (procedurally-built JSON specs under upstream's
#   ``src/environments/generated/generated_network_*.json``).
#   :func:`_load_generated_topologies` parses each JSON at import time and
#   builds a :class:`TopologySpec` automatically. Generated topologies
#   use the ``external_attacker`` foothold name and ``host_<N>_subnet_<M>``
#   victim naming — distinct from hand-tuned so each entry carries its
#   own ``foothold_name_prefix``.

class MHBenchProvider(BaseBenchmarkProvider):
    """Benchmark provider wrapping the upstream MHBench CLI.

    Decepticon delegates topology lifecycle (setup / teardown) to MHBench's
    ``main.py`` and assumes an external OpenStack tenant is reachable from
    the host. No local Docker is involved — all targets live as VMs in the
    OpenStack project named by the operator's MHBench ``config.json``.

    ``setup()`` plants a deterministic ``FLAG{<sha256>}`` on the
    topology-selected victim via upstream's ``ansible/goals/addFlag.yml``.
    Decepticon's evaluator pattern-matches that flag in agent output the
    same way XBOWProvider does.

    **Foothold-first semantics.** MHBench's research framing is
    *post-initial-access*: the attacker already controls one Kali host
    inside the target tenant and must demonstrate lateral movement,
    privilege escalation, and credential collection from that substrate.
    The provider mirrors that framing:

    * ``target_url`` returned from ``setup()`` is the victim host IP —
      "what to compromise."
    * The foothold (Kali attacker VM) is *not* the target. It is the
      execution substrate: every offensive command the agent emits is
      SSH-wrapped to run there via ProxyJump through the jump host.
    * Reachability details (foothold SSH template, jump host IP, key
      path) are written to ``MHBENCH_CONNECT.md`` in the engagement
      workspace; the agent reads it as its first action.

    **Topology-agnostic.** All per-topology data (env_type, victim name
    prefixes, flag selector, level, tags) lives in :data:`_TOPOLOGIES`.
    Adding a new MHBench topology to Decepticon's benchmark suite is a
    metadata edit — no provider code change.

        SSH plumbing notes (validated live against a Chain2Hosts deploy):

        * The management/jump host enforces cloud-init's default user
          (``ubuntu``), so the SSH login as ``root`` is rejected with
          "Please login as the user 'ubuntu' rather than the user 'root'".
          Provider authenticates the jump hop as ``spec.jump_ssh_user``.
        * Inside the tenant, the victim host accepts SSH as its cloud-init
          default user (``spec.victim_ssh_user`` — ``ubuntu`` for Ubuntu
          rings); the playbook elevates to ``spec.flag_owner`` via
          ``ansible_become=sudo`` to land the flag at /root with the
          right ownership.
        * OpenSSH's ``-J`` ProxyJump option does NOT propagate ``-i`` to
          the inner ssh subprocess; tested on the deployed DevStack and
          consistently fails with "Permission denied (publickey)" at the
          jump step. The reliable form is an explicit
          ``ProxyCommand=ssh ... -W %h:%p <user>@<jump>``. We also set
          ``IdentitiesOnly=yes`` + ``IdentityAgent=none`` so any stray
          agent keys don't exhaust MaxAuthTries before our ``-i`` key
